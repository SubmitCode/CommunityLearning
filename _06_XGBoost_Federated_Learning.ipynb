    " > Define $N$ data owners ${F1, ...FN }$, all of whom wish to train a machine learning model by consolidating their respective data ${D1, ...DN }$. A conventional method is to put all data together and use $D = D1 ∪ ... ∪ DN$ to train a model $M_{SUM}$ . A federated learning system is a learning process in which the data owners collaboratively train a model $M_{FED}$ , in which process any data owner $F_i$ does not expose its data $D_i$ to others. In addition, the accuracy of $M_{FED}$ , denoted as $V_{FED}$ should be very close to the performance of $M_{SUM}$ , $V_{SUM}$ . Formally, let $\\delta$ be a non-negative real number, if \n",
    "$$| V_{FED} − V_{SUM} | < \\delta$$ \n",
    "we say the federated learning algorithm has $\\delta$-accuracy loss.\n"
